<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Mark. I’ve worked in technical support before, and honestly, I realized I really enjoy helping people. There’s something satisfying about taking a frustrating situation and turning it into a good experience—just being able to ease someone’s stress or make their day a little better feels meaningful to me. Over time, I’ve learned how to stay patient, really listen, and find solutions that make sense—not just for the company, but for the actual person I’m talking to.</p>

<p>What I’m looking for next is a place where the work feels like it matters. Somewhere with a team that communicates openly, has each other’s backs, and actually cares about what they do. I really appreciate leaders who are approachable and real—people who trust you to do your job but are there when you need support.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I just want to do good work with good people. I’m dependable, calm under pressure, and I try to bring empathy into every interaction. Whether it’s solving a problem or just being someone a customer can count on, I always want the person on the other end to feel heard and taken care of.</p>
