<h1>Christian's Movie Recommendations</h1> 
 <h2>My Top 3 Movies of all Time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Transformers</h3>
<p>Giant alien robots come to Earth—some want to protect us, others want to destroy us. They disguise themselves as cars and trucks, and there’s a lot of explosive action as humans get caught in the middle of their war.</p>
<br>
<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>A retired hitman is forced back into the violent underworld after someone kills his dog—the last gift from his late wife. What follows is pure, stylish revenge with intense fight scenes and cool world-building.</p>
<br>
<h3>Borderlands</h3>
<p>Based on the video game, it's a wild, chaotic sci-fi adventure where a group of misfits team up on a dangerous planet to find a mysterious girl who could change everything. Expect crazy action, dark humor, and lots of weirdness.</p>
